# Simple Neural Network in PyTorch

A basic **one-hidden-layer neural network** implemented in PyTorch for **classifying non-linearly separable 1D data**. This project explores training with **Cross-Entropy Loss** and **Mean Squared Error (MSE) Loss**.

## Features
- ✅ Single-layer neural network with Sigmoid activation  
- ✅ Custom training function with visualization  
- ✅ Comparison of **MSE Loss** vs. **Cross-Entropy Loss**  
- ✅ Implemented in PyTorch  

## Usage
Clone the repository and run the script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-nn-pytorch.git
cd simple-nn-pytorch
python train.py
